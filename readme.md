# ISDB
This application is partially based off of an API I developed in 2021 that serve which can be found [here](https://github.com/JMcc888/2021_Music_API). Through this application, users can create an account and submit information about artists of their choice. Upon creating an artist, song collections which are either singles or albums can be submitted along with songs that appear in the designated collection.
